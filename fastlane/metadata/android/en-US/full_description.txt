NoProvider2Push is a UnifiedPush distributor able to provide push notifications without a push provider. It's a pretty niche UnifiedPush distributor mostly useful for development purposes and advanced users at this moment.

To work, it needs a static address even with the roaming. It is achievable with a custom network such as a VPN (eg. wireguard) or the yggdrasil network.
